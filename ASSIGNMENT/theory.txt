//1. What is inheritance?
The process in which one class derive the properties of another class

//2. Which inheritance is not supported by Dart? Why?
it is dynamic language that why not supported.In Dart multiple inheritance is not supported.
inheritance is easy to use.

//3. What is advantage of inheritance?
Inheritance can save time and effort as the main code need not be written again.

//4. Difference between inheritance and encapsulation.
Encapsulation is a Wrapping up the data.
Inheritance  is derived from one class to another class.

//5. Difference between inheritance and abstraction.
Inheritance  is derived from one class to another class. while
Abstraction allows Hiding Internal Details and Showing
Functionalities.

//6. Difference between inheritance and polymorphism.
Inheritance  is derived from one class to another class.
The word polymorphism means having multiple forms

//7. Can we override static method in Dart?
No, you cannot override a static method in Dart because static methods belong
to the class itself

//8. Can we overload static method in Dart?
No, we cannot overload static methods in Dart. The concept of overloading
should create multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

//9. Can a class implement more than one interface?
Yes, a class can implement more than one interface

//10. Can a class extend more than one class in Dart?
No, a class can only extend to one class

//11. Can an interface extend more than one interface in Dart?
Yes, an interface in Dart can extend more than one interface.

//12. What will happen if a class implements two interfaces and they both have a method
//with same name and signature?
if class implement two interfaces and both have a same name and signature then only one
method will be shown.

//13. Can we pass an object of a subclass to a method expecting an object of the super
//class?
yes

//14. Are static members inherited to sub classes?
yes

//15. What happens if the parent and the child class have a field with same identifier?
It will hide the parent class field

//16. Are constructors and initializers also inherited to sub classes?
No

//17. How do you restrict a member of a class from inheriting by its sub classes?
There is no direct way to restrict a member of a class from inheriting by its subclasses

//18. How do you implement multiple inheritance in Dart? Can a class extend by itself in
//Dart?
we can not implement multiple inheritance in dart.
No a class cannot extend by itself in Dart.

//19. How do you override a private method in Dart?
We cannot override private methods in dart

//20. When to overload a method in Dart and when to override it?
when override a method then we have to use abstract
and overloading then we have to use optional parameter.

//21. What the order is of extends and implements keyword on Dart class declaration?


//23. How do you prevent overriding a Dart method without using the final modifier?


//24. What are the rules of method overriding in Dart?
The return type should be the same as present in the superclass.

//22. Difference between method overriding and overloading in Dart.
overriding method support in Dart
overloading is not supported in Dart

//23. What happens when a class implements two interfaces and both declare field
//(variable) with same name?
When a class implements two interfaces and both declare field (variable) with the
same name a compilation error will occur.

//24. Can a subclass instance method override a superclass static method?
No an instance method cannot override a static method.

//25. Can a subclass static method hide superclass instance method?
Can a subclass static method cannot hide superclass instance method

//26. Can a superclass access subclass member?
No

//27. Difference between object oriented and object based language.
Object Oriented: Does support features like inheritance,
polymorphism, encapsulation and abstraction.

Object Based: Does not support inheritance and polymorphism.
